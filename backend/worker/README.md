# Migration workers (BullMQ on Valkey)

Background jobs that migrate the Neon prod data + images onto the Hetzner stack.
Pattern mirrors boahaus-backend (BullMQ + ioredis) and clickup-argo's concurrency
safety (Valkey `SET NX EX` lock, atomic guarded `UPDATE … WHERE photo_migrated_at
IS NULL`, deterministic jobIds).

> **Scope:** this `worker/` system is the **one-time backlog migration** (old
> base64-in-DB photos + external image URLs → R2). NEW photos uploaded through
> the live API no longer go through here — the app uploads them to R2 at ingest
> time via `backend/src/lib/r2.ts` (stores the CDN URL in the `photo` column, stamps
> `photo_migrated_at`). See "App-side R2 (new uploads)" below.

## What it does

1. **migrate-tables** — copies every `public` table from Neon → Hetzner `app` DB,
   idempotently (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT` upsert / ignore per `tables.ts`). Keyset-
   batched (handles the 78k `missing_persons`). **Re-runnable** = pull new syncs.
2. **migrate-photos** — one job per row id. Moves the photo to R2 and rewrites the
   `photo` column to the CDN URL, then stamps `photo_migrated_at` (resumable):
   - base64-in-DB photos (`data:image/...`) → decode → R2.
   - external URLs (`photo_external_url`, mostly AWS S3) → fetch → R2 (rate-limited).

## Pieces

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `redis.ts` | ioredis from `VALKEY_URL` + distributed lock (acquire/release/heartbeat) |
| `db.ts` | pg Pools: target (Hetzner `DATABASE_URL`) + source (`NEON_DATABASE_URL`) |
| `r2.ts` | S3-compatible R2 upload (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) |
| `tables.ts` | per-table PK + conflict policy (update vs ignore) |
| `jobs/migrateTable.ts` | keyset-batched upsert copy |
| `jobs/migratePhoto.ts` | base64/external → R2; short read txn + atomic guarded `UPDATE … WHERE photo_migrated_at IS NULL` |
| `queues.ts` | BullMQ queues + worker factory + producers |
| `index.ts` | worker entrypoint (graceful SIGTERM) |
| `enqueue.ts` | producer: acquires the Valkey lock, enqueues tables then photos |

## Run

Deployed as a **`migrate-worker` Deployment** reusing the same `*-backend`
image (no separate Dockerfile target — web/worker/migrate are the same artifact,
distinguished only by `command`). To run the migration:

```bash
# workers are already running (the Deployment). Kick off the producer Job:
kubectl -n mapa delete job migrate-enqueue --ignore-not-found
kubectl -n mapa apply -f infra/k8s/migrate-enqueue-job.yaml
kubectl -n mapa logs -f job/migrate-enqueue
# watch progress
kubectl -n mapa logs -f deploy/migrate-worker
```

Re-run the enqueue Job anytime to pull new Neon syncs / pick up pending photos —
deterministic jobIds + the `photo_migrated_at` stamp make it safe & resumable.

## Env (from `app-env` + `migrate-env` secrets)

`DATABASE_URL` (target), `VALKEY_URL`, `NEON_DATABASE_URL` (source),
`R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_STATIC_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
`R2_PUBLIC_BASE`. Tunables: `PHOTOS_CONCURRENCY`, `TABLES_CONCURRENCY`,
`PHOTO_RATE_MAX`, `PHOTO_RATE_DURATION_MS`.

## Local

```bash
npm run worker            # run workers against your .env (tsx worker/index.ts)
npx tsx worker/enqueue.ts # run the producer
```

## App-side R2 (new uploads — not this worker)

`backend/src/lib/r2.ts` is the **request-path** R2 helper, the app equivalent of
`worker/r2.ts` (same env, same `images/<table>/<id>.<ext>` key scheme). The
public POST endpoints use it so new photos never land as base64 in Postgres:

| Write path | Uploads via | Stores |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/missing` (`services/missing.ts addMissing`) | `uploadPhotoDataUrl(_, "missing_persons", id)` | CDN URL in `photo` + `photo_migrated_at` |
| `POST /api/reports` (`services/reports.ts addReport`) | `uploadPhotoDataUrl(_, "reports", id)` | CDN URL in `photo` + `photo_migrated_at` |
| `POST /api/missing/:id/found` (`services/missing.ts markMissingFound`) | `uploadPhotoDataUrl(_, "resolution", id)` | CDN URL in `resolution_photo` |

- **Policy:** if R2 is configured (`isR2Configured()` — all 5 `R2_*` vars set),
  uploads MUST succeed; a failure **throws** and the endpoint does not confirm
  the write (no silent base64 fallback). With R2 unconfigured (local dev /
  memory store), the legacy base64-in-DB path is kept.
- The three GET photo routes now **302-redirect** when `photo` holds a URL
  (migrated or freshly R2-uploaded) instead of decoding base64 — required, since
  this migration rewrites `photo` to CDN URLs while the app is live.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way — don't reintroduce)

- **BullMQ custom jobIds (regular `queue.add`) cannot contain `:`** — it throws
  `Custom Id cannot contain :`. Use `-` separators (`tbl-<name>`,
  `img-<table>-<uuid>`), matching boahaus's `generateJobId` (`mod-type-iso-rand`).
  (boahaus's `notif:uid:rule` colons are OK only because those are *repeatable*
  jobs — the `:` ban applies solely to regular-job custom ids.)
- **Pin `ioredis` to bullmq's exact version** (`5.10.1`). bullmq pins ioredis
  exactly (not a range); a different root version installs two copies and TS
  errors on the `Worker` connection type.
- **Dockerfile stage order**: `runtime` (the app) must be the LAST stage, and the
  app build must pass `target: runtime`. If `worker` is last and a build omits
  `--target`, docker builds the worker image and pushes it under the app tag —
  the app then has no `.next/static` (R2 upload + the app both break).
- `worker/` is excluded from the app `tsconfig.json`; it has its own
  `worker/tsconfig.json` (`target: es2022`, `module: esnext`,
  `moduleResolution: bundler`, `paths "@/*": ["../*"]` — **not** `nodenext`,
  which would treat the files as CJS and break `import.meta` in `lib/*`) and
  runs via `tsx`.
