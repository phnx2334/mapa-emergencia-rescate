# Terremoto Venezuela Analytics Tracking Plan

Status: draft for implementation before cloning proposal repos.

## Measurement Readiness Index

Current score: 58 / 100 — Unreliable, but fixable.

Breakdown:

- Decision alignment: 17 / 25
- Event model clarity: 11 / 20
- Data accuracy/integrity: 10 / 20
- Conversion definition quality: 6 / 15
- Attribution/context: 7 / 10
- Governance/maintenance: 7 / 10

Reasoning:

- OpenPanel is installed and production-gated.
- Screen views, outgoing links, attributes, and several completion events exist.
- There is no complete event taxonomy yet.
- Key UX questions are not measurable yet: failed searches, post-search reporting, contextual prompt usefulness, hospital lookup intent, and rescuer/first-line interest.
- Privacy rules are not documented in code-level tracking conventions yet.

Target after implementation: 82 / 100 — Usable with gaps.

## Privacy Rules

Never send these to analytics:

- Names of missing people.
- Names of hospital patients.
- Phone numbers.
- Exact addresses.
- Free-text descriptions.
- Photos or photo URLs.
- Contact fields.
- Hospital patient notes.
- Exact trapped-person coordinates in sensitive flows.
- Admin passwords or tokens.

Allowed context:

- Page path.
- Section name.
- Flow name.
- Boolean flags such as `has_photo`, `has_age`, `has_query`.
- Counts/buckets such as `results_count_bucket`.
- Report type.
- Hospital priority zone.
- Country code if available.
- Generic location confidence such as `country_known` or `region_known`.

## Core Questions

The tracking should answer:

- Which home action do users choose first?
- Are users searching before reporting?
- How often do searches fail?
- Do failed searches lead to missing-person reports?
- Are users finding hospital/patient flows?
- Are people outside Venezuela trying to help?
- Are contextual prompts useful or ignored?
- Which help resources are most used?
- Are volunteers/rescuers trying to access coordination views?
- Which proposal produces the clearest path to critical actions?

## Implementation Notes

- Keep using `trackEvent` from `app/components/openpanel.ts`.
- Add a small wrapper of named functions to avoid typo-heavy event calls.
- Keep events production-gated.
- Add `variant` once proposal repos exist, using a constant per repo.
- Use buckets instead of exact counts where useful:
  - `0`
  - `1`
  - `2_5`
  - `6_20`
  - `21_plus`
- Add validation screenshots/log checks in production preview when possible.

## Validation Checklist

- Verify each event fires once per user action.
- Verify no PII is present in OpenPanel payloads.
- Verify mobile Safari and Chrome.
- Verify failed search and no-results CTA.
- Verify contextual prompt shown/clicked/dismissed.
- Verify form errors produce non-sensitive `form_error_shown`.
- Verify OpenPanel stays disabled on localhost unless explicitly configured.
